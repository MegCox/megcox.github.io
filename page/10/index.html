        <p>After Athens I spent a further 2.5 weeks in Greece. I’ve been a bit lax on including logistic details recently, so just to remind you of the realities of travelling over land I’ve included all the transport this time!</p>
<h3 id="Week-1-Crete"><a href="#Week-1-Crete" class="headerlink" title="Week 1 - Crete"></a>Week 1 - Crete</h3><img src="/2022/10/02/greece/crete.png" class="" title="Crete">

<p>I took an overnight ferry from Piraeus (the port part of Athens) to Heraklion, Crete. It was surprisingly difficult to find the ferry at the huge port, with no information signs to be seen. I initially boarded the wrong one, but ended up securing a nice sofa seat on the correct one. I lay out my sleeping bag and got myself ready for bed, only to be told by a staff member that I couldn’t sleep until 11pm (it was currently 9pm). I found that very odd but was happy to watch some netflix until 11, before having a mildly uncomfortable night’s sleep. We arrived into Heraklion for 7am and I had all morning to kill so slowly walked in the direction of the bus station. Just up the road I saw the golden arches of a Mcdonald’s and realised that a maccies breakfast is exactly what I fancied! The bright 24/7 sign laughed down at me when I realised it was closed. But seeing as I really did have all morning with nothing to do, I decided to sit outside and read my book until it opened. 1.5 hours later, having finished my book, it finally opened. Very excited to eat the breakfast I’d been thinking about for so long it was a great disappointment to see that they were not offering a breakfast menu. With too much time invested in the venture I begrudgingly ordered a burger and a coffee and ate it. At least there was good wifi and I could work on some blog posts! </p>
<p>Now the reason I was in Crete was to meet friends from home for their annual holiday get together. They weren’t arriving until 2am the next morning so I was the first one to get to the hotel. I’ve stayed in some hostels which have left a lot to desire, this hotel was cut from the same cloth. Luckily I was there to spend time with friends rather than have a luxury experience! Going down in the evening to eat dinner at the all inclusive buffet was the first time on the trip I’ve felt self-conscious eating alone. In the middle of the night I woke to Sam arriving into my room, I gave him a sleepy hug and my time alone ended for a bit. We spent the next week doing all sorts of holiday activities - relaxing by the pool, going to a waterpark (my personal highlight surprisingly), hiring a car and exploring the island, playing lots of cards, spending time at the beach. It was so wonderful to see friends and spend time with them all. I wasn’t feeling homesick, but this banished any potential homesickness! </p>
<p>One notable event was the Queen’s death. The news came in just as we’d finished eating dinner. We crowded into the largest one of our rooms and watched the BBC news broadcast on the tiny TV. An interesting place to have been for the moment! The following day a slightly less notable event took place - my birthday! It was lovely to spend it with friends, with us going to the waterpark and out for a nice dinner and drinks.</p>
<p>At the end of the week I said my goodbyes to everyone and returned to Heraklion to get the overnight ferry back to Athens. Here it sunk in that I likely won’t see my friends until next July. Feeling quite sad I watched some uplifting tv to cheer me up and then made a bed out of two chairs (no sofas on this ferry). </p>
<h3 id="The-middle-bit-Meteora"><a href="#The-middle-bit-Meteora" class="headerlink" title="The middle bit - Meteora"></a>The middle bit - Meteora</h3><img src="/2022/10/02/greece/meteora.png" class="" title="Meteora">

<p>The ferry arrived late into Athens which meant I missed the direct train to my next location, Kalambaka. Once at the main train station I worked out my new route. It was only two trains so not too bad! This was my first train journey since travelling from Mostar to Sarajevo in Bosnia in June, and I enjoyed it hugely. The first train was late so we missed the connecting train, but luckily there was another train that arrived shortly after we did. Arriving in Kalambaka I immediately saw the reason I’d come here - the huge rock columns rising out of nowhere, with tiny monasteries perched on top of them. The rocks and monasteries are known as Meteora.</p>
<p>I stayed here for 2 nights, walking up to the monasteries to watch the sunset and hitchhiking back down to the town both nights (my first experience of hitchhiking!). It was so peaceful and like nothing I’d ever seen before. On my full day I hiked the monasteries with Pjotr, a dutch guy from the hostel. We walked to all six in the area, taking in all of the scenic points en route. We went into one monastery and one nunnery - St Stephens and Varlaam. Men had to wear long trousers and women long skirts to enter. They were both beautiful and interesting, with little museums. But the real treasure was the views. The huge columns of rock with the little monasteries stacked on top. The vibrant green forests laying in between.</p>
<p>There was a Lidl in Kalambaka which excited me a bit too much, and I enjoyed cooking a delicious and healthy dinner with Pjotr. It had been too long since I’d cooked, and I do really miss it.</p>
<h3 id="Week-2-Corfu"><a href="#Week-2-Corfu" class="headerlink" title="Week 2 - Corfu"></a>Week 2 - Corfu</h3><img src="/2022/10/02/greece/corfu.png" class="" title="Corfu">

<p>Next stop on my Greece trip was Corfu, to meet my family! I caught a bus to Ioannina which took 2.5 hours, then immediately a bus to Igoumenitsa. I caught a ferry to Corfu and walked to the airport, waiting for my family to land. Sadly, their flight was delayed by several hours (another reason to favour land travel!). Finally they arrived, and it was so wonderful to see them! It had been just over 4 months, but it felt like we had a lot to catch up on and it was very comforting to see them. We got our transfer to the airbnb and hurried out to eat before the restaurants closed.</p>
<p>Our villa was beautiful, perched up the hill with sea views to be enjoyed from the terrace which included a pool. This week was spent exploring nearby towns by bus, including the Durrells house, spending time on the beach, snorkelling, enjoying good food, chilling by the pool and lots more cards. My highlight was hiring a boat and speeding around the north east coast, stopping at tranquil coves to swim and snorkel, and learning how to dive in from the boat (thanks Dad!). </p>
<p>Spending time with my family was so restful and, like the time spent with friends, meant any potential homesickness was gone. Before leaving I washed all of my clothes, charged up all of my devices and replenished my toiletries. Both me and my backpack were refreshed and it felt like I was starting out fresh, rather than being 4.5 months in.</p>
<h3 id="Onwards-Thessaloniki"><a href="#Onwards-Thessaloniki" class="headerlink" title="Onwards - Thessaloniki"></a>Onwards - Thessaloniki</h3><img src="/2022/10/02/greece/thessaloniki.png" class="" title="Thessaloniki">

<p>My brother, Harvey, was joining me for Istanbul so we waved goodbye to our parents together as we got the bus to Corfu town. Here we caught a direct bus all the way to Thessaloniki, with it taking 6 hours. We got off the bus after a short time to get onto the ferry, and re-boarded back on the mainland. We spent one night in Thessaloniki, doing a whirlwind tour of the city which we thought was nice but nothing too special. It was a day of freebies: all of the historical sights were free to enter on that day for some reason, we accidentally went to a university freshers’ fair and got a free water bottle, we went on a free boat ride around the gulf. But some things really are too good to be true, and the boat ride was not really free, with us having to buy a drink onboard which cost an insane amount - 9EUR for a large beer! The main stand out for me was the food - all of our meals here were excellent.</p>
<p>From Thessaloniki we got an overnight bus to Istanbul. This was my least favourite overnight bus so far. It was way too hot and the lady sat behind me had stacks of bangles from wrist to elbow on both arms that made the most irritating noise when she moved her arms, which she seemed to do the entire journey. We had to wait a while at the border, being forced to go into a duty free lounge which was strange. The bus arrived 1.5 hours early, which is usually a great thing but when it means you arrive at 5:30am rather than 7am and with 1.5 hours less sleep, it’s less fun.</p>
<h3 id="Overall"><a href="#Overall" class="headerlink" title="Overall"></a>Overall</h3><p>Greece was a weird one, it was a time spent seeing friends and family more than travelling. I didn’t fall in love with the country, a part from Athens. I was surprised at how much I loved the food, and how varied Greek cuisine is. An absolute stand-out dish was the lamb Kleftiko. It was one of the best dishes I’ve ever eaten. I ate three in my time in Greece, and they were all quite different with one important similarity - they were full of the same amazing flavour and were truly delicious. I will definitely be attempting to cook my own version at home. I also enjoyed the hospitality in Greece, with it being common to receive a free sweet treat after a meal, or a drink, or a platter of fruit.</p>

        <p>The time has come to head East, and with it the summer heat will end. Very luckily, my family has come out to meet me in Corfu and was able to bring me some items from home to revamp my packing from ‘European summer’ to ‘Central Asian winter’. So, as a break from the travel posts, here’s a packing update and discussion - what’s being swapped in, items I’ve used all the time and value, and ones that I’ve already ditched. This is probably quite a boring post for most, so feel free to skip. I weirdly enjoy reading dull, routine narratives so this is me indulging myself.</p>
<h3 id="General-items-I’ve-loved-or-hated"><a href="#General-items-I’ve-loved-or-hated" class="headerlink" title="General items I’ve loved or hated"></a>General items I’ve loved or hated</h3><p>I have a lot of ‘useful’ items in my bag, but let’s assess how useful they’ve really been…</p>
<p><strong>Very useful:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Two microfibre towels. Having one that’s reserved for showering only was such a good decision, as my beach/yoga mat/picnic blanket one does get very gross.</li>
<li>Headphones and earphones. Goes without saying, of course it was worthwhile to bring my big silencing headphones even if I only really use them on buses and occasionally in the evenings in hostels.</li>
<li>Sleeping bag. I really debated bringing this but the juries in and I’m glad I did. I’ve only used it a handful of times (camping on the beach, an overnight ferry, staying with friends in England before I left) but it’s been essential in those moments. I also use it as a pillow on overnight buses.</li>
<li>Uniqlo little shoulder bag. Literally use it everyday. Also get a lot of compliments on it so that’s always nice. It looks small but I’ve been able to fit a beach towel, my bikini, swimming bottle, kindle, purse, phone, earphones, lipbalm etc. all in it for a compact beach day.</li>
<li>Folding shopping bag. Has come in handy for both shopping and beach days which require more than I can fit in my small bag but less than in my rucksack.</li>
<li>Travel wash. No debate here, was always going to be washing underwear in hostel sinks and that’s exactly what I’ve been doing.</li>
<li>Reusable sandwich bag. So useful for packed lunches, or storing food items like homemade cookies! Have used it a lot.</li>
<li>Then there are the items that were never in question (multiple bank cards, padlocks, ear plugs and eye mask etc.).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Not really used but will keep for now:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Mini tripod. Have used it maybe twice? Turns out I’m always doing stuff with people and they’re happy to take photos of me!</li>
<li>Travel line. Used it once and lost it. Replaced it with a piece of string and not used it since. But that’s because it’s been summer so I’ve been able to leave stuff outside to dry. Although, thinking about it, I often hang up my underwear around my dorm bed and will likely continue doing that. It takes up 0 space so will keep anyway.</li>
<li>Waterproof phone cover. I don’t trust that it’s actually waterproof. Useful for boat trips though.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sent home/gave away:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Cap. Cut my hair and suddenly the back of my neck was exposed to the sun, meaning a larger rimmed hat was required, but wasn’t the cap’s fault! Gave my cap to a girl in Brac, Croatia.</li>
<li>Wooly hat. Used it once in Prague but it was a bit silly to pack it. I’ve sent one parcel home so far (from Slovenia) and it was in that. It has now returned to the bag however!</li>
<li>Denim jacket. Took up too much space and was heavy, realised I wasn’t going to be wearing it for months and it wasn’t that practical when it actually gets cold. Sent home.</li>
<li>Jeans. Same as denim jacket, but knew my family could bring them back out ready for colder months.</li>
<li>Hiking shorts/trousers. Realised I could hike in my normal shorts and I didn’t enjoy wearing these casually, gave them to a charity shop in Lljubljana.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>New useful items</strong><br>During the last few months travelling I’ve mulled over potentially useful items to add for the next bit of the journey and three of these made the cut.</p>
<ol>
<li>A filtration water bottle. It was super expensive so I took my time to decide if it was actually necessary but ultimately decided that it was. It filters any water (apart from seawater) to make it drinkable. This means when the tap water isn’t drinkable (like in South East Asia and I’m guessing central Asia too) I’ll still be able to drink it and won’t have to buy a ton of bottled water. The main reason for purchasing it is to reduce my plastic consumption in these countries, and it will likely be more convenient and will come in handy when hiking etc. too!</li>
<li>Healthy gut bacteria tablets to take daily. After the decimating effect of the stomach bug I had in Albania, my microbiome seems to need some help to recover (read: my stomach hasn’t been quite right since). Hopefully these will also help me avoid a similar situation again, or at least reduce the impact of it.</li>
<li>Immodium tablets. If the above doesn’t fight off a stomach issue in the future (I’m not too hopeful to be honest) I thought it wise to have some emergency immodium!</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Capsule-wardrobe-update"><a href="#Capsule-wardrobe-update" class="headerlink" title="Capsule wardrobe update"></a>Capsule wardrobe update</h3><p>My few items of clothing changed quite a lot from my original packing to now. After getting rid of my jeans and jacket I had space to introduce a few more summery pieces (a short skirt from a thrift shop in Lljubljana, a long skirt from a charity shop in Mostar, a dress from a boutique in Lljubljana, some more crop tops). I also got bored of items so when I saw friends in Montenegro in August I had them bring me different items and sent old ones home with them. I did the same when I saw more friends in Crete in September. (Thanks again lovely people that brought me out items!) Overall, I wished I packed ‘nicer’ clothes rather than strictly practical ones. But I also enjoyed shopping for nicer items here, and wasn’t too attached to the ones I had meaning I was okay with donating them to charity shops/hostel swap rails.</p>
<p>But now we’re doing a big overhaul. So here’s the new wardrobe:</p>
<img src="/2022/09/20/updated-packing/1.png" class="" title="New wardrobe">

<p>Bit of a nightmare with the boots, but as always it worked out fine. Before leaving home my walking boots died and I didn’t have time to buy and break in a new pair. I decided to order a pair of casual walking boots and have my family bring them out, and hope they fit. They did fit! But they immediately broke, with one of the shoelace holders breaking off… Turns out this was easily fixed, and luckily Greece is a country where repairing things is the norm, so it was easy to track down a shoe repair shop and they made quick work of it. I also got a full refund on the boots, so all in all it worked out very well!</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>After having spent around three months in the Balkans I’d say I’m familiar with most of their food. It’s pastry and meat based, with a lot of stuffed vegetables. White cheese is featured heavily, even in their salads, like the shopska salad. A lot of the food remained constant - bureks always available from bakeries, little doughnuts for breakfast at anywhere serving traditional food, plain meat patties always on the menu, fig jam and ajvar always ready to be spread on bread. But something I’ve enjoyed is watching how it slightly varies between countries, with each one having its own spin on dishes. I found that Albania had region specific dishes in a way that I didn’t see in the other countries, for example I had the Berati steak in Berat, and the Himare salad in, you guessed it, Himare. Below is a collection of photos of Balkan food and an in depth look on Burek.</p>
<img src="/2022/09/18/balkan-food/1.png" class="">
<img src="/2022/09/18/balkan-food/2.png" class="">

<h3 id="Burek"><a href="#Burek" class="headerlink" title="Burek"></a>Burek</h3><p>This is a filo pastry pie. It’s not exclusive to the Balkans, being eaten in Israel, Northern Africa and Armenia to name some others. It originated in the Ottoman empire, so spread into the Balkans with the Ottoman rule in the 14th century. In the Balkans you will find it filled with either white cheese, spinach or meat. It’s eaten for breakfast, lunch or as a snack. You can purchase one from any bakery, for around 1.50/2 EUR. It’s served with a yogurt to drink alongside. It seems to come in two styles: i) one huge pie is cooked and you can buy a slice of this, or ii) as an individual pie. I prefer the huge pie version, I felt like you got a better filling to pastry ratio that way. I definitely favoured the meat burek, with the filling reminding me of a Cornish pasty, and therefore all of the warm home feelings associated with it. The spinach comes in second for me, with the cheese being a bit too much - too salty, too dense and a bit sickly. The meat one with the yogurt to wash it down really is a high class lunch (but will leave you desperate for some fruit or vegetables). It has a lot of cultural significance and is an icon of the Balkans, but not always in a positive way. Slovenia, a country that struggles with its identity as Balkan or Western European, shunned the burek, seeing it as a symbol of the ‘undeveloped Balkans, freighted with the metageographical baggage’ of the region (quoted from the book <em>Everyday life in the Balkans, chapter titled ‘Burek, Da!’).</em> The burek came to Slovenia with the formation of Yugoslavia, so perhaps the dislike towards it can be understood in that context. It shows one underlying current in Yugoslavia: the friction between the more developed and less developed countries. Taking a step back from Yugoslav politics and looking at the Balkans as a whole, I feel the burek also illustrates another reoccurring theme: the struggle between nationalism and homogeneous culture. The burek is found in all of the Balkan countries, but each claims ownership of it. When I was googling recipes for burek I found them titled ‘Croatian burek’, ‘Albanian burek’, ‘Bosnian pita’ etc. Rather than embracing the shared food, and their shared history, the nations either ignore it or are angered by it. Obviously there are reasons for this, the Balkan wars were recent and there is a long history of aggression between the nations (to quote a Macedonian man “We are brothers with our neighbouring countries, not friends. That means we like to fight.”). The shared burek speaks to their shared history, which may not be pleasant to remember.</p>
<p>Burek is one of the foods that I’ll definitely think back to, and likely crave. But it’s the only Balkan food that I feel that way towards! My old local pub in London recently had a burek pop-up from Mystic Borek, so I was happy to learn it’s possible to get burek in London.

<p>The main thing I loved about Balkan food wasn’t the food itself (it really did lack vegetables and was always heavy and salty) but becoming so familiar with it. Obviously I’m not an expert, but I could pick up a menu and explain to you what the majority, if not all, of the items are. I’ve eaten the traditional breakfasts, the traditional lunches, the traditional pastries in the traditional way, and all of the traditional meals for dinner. And perhaps I’m being harsh in saying it’s all heavy and salty, it is also often delicious, warming and made with passion. It was very enjoyable to eat. But it’s not the sort of food I personally enjoy eating all of the time!</p>

I was having a wonderful time bumbling around Albania and I wasn’t ready to move on yet. And the 9 hour bus journey starting at 5:30am didn’t help. Athens wasn’t somewhere that I actively wanted to visit, it was just where I was catching the ferry to Crete from. The bus was long and busy and hot. Stepping off in Athens my first impression was the smell of urine. I walked to the hostel and with each 100 metres I woke up from my bus stupor and the warmth of Athens crept in. After showering and freshening up in the hostel I felt excited to go and explore. I walked down the street to the centre, and audibly said “oh shit” as the buildings opened up into Monastiraki square, and my view was suddenly filled with the Acropolis on the rocky hill, and ancient buildings in between. It came out of nowhere and I wasn’t expecting it. It was breathtaking. Strolling around Athens I realised how different the Balkans felt to Western Europe, with Athens having the familiarity that they didn’t. The sun was starting to set and I marched up to Lycabettus Hill to watch it. I was cutting it very tight so basically had to run up the hill. I was very sweaty. Lots of people had stopped on the path before the top, which I thought was strange and did make me think it means the top must be very crowded. This assumption was right! It was humorously busy at the top, and people clapped when the sun set. I stayed up there until it started to get dark, wanting to see the Acropolis lit up. I went out for dinner alone that evening, the first time in a while! I had the most incredible beet salad, with whipped cheese and candied walnuts. When it was served to me I was immediately hit by the smell - fresh mint sprinkled across the top. The candied walnuts were so delicately flavoured. There was the rich taste of EVOO beneath the acidity of the vinegar dressing. I was working on my Balkan food blog post at the time, and it did put it in perspective a bit…</p>
<p>After one evening in Athens I had decided that it was somewhere I will definitely be coming back to. I can picture myself remote working from here for a week or so, soaking up the heat and the history before and after work. Not sure if that’s actually an option for me, but the idea kept me happy. People had told me that you only needed one or two nights in Athens, and that might be true if you just want to tick off the sights, but Athens seems to me to be a city that you could spend a week in without getting bored. There’s not a lot to see, but there’s a lot to experience. Because I knew I’d be coming back, I didn’t worry about seeing everything. I spent most of my time wandering around and looking everywhere. I spent 30 minutes laying on a marble bench on top of the Pnyx, soaking up the sun with a view of the Acropolis. I really didn’t rush around! I specifically decided not to enter the Acropolis or the ancient sights. It costs 30EUR (free if you’re under 25 and from an EU country, thanks again brexit…) but gives you access to all of the sights for 5 days. I didn’t have time to properly make use of this, and wasn’t in the mood to speed around them, opting to save them for my next visit. I did do the walking tour of course. It wasn’t the most history heavy tour, but I enjoyed the slow pace and friendly atmosphere the tour guide created. </p>
<img src="/2022/09/10/athens/a1.png" class="" title="Athens">

<p>Alongside the pockets of ancient history, Athens had so many beautiful cafes and restaurants. In the centre the streets were beautiful, especially just under the Acropolis. Further out the streets were ugly and filled with unassuming looking cafes, bakeries and taverns. It was down these streets, in the pouring rain, that I searched for the place serving the reportedly best greek yogurt.  It came out as a block, almost like feta, drenched in honey and covered in chopped walnuts. It was utterly delicious. The yogurt itself was creamy with such a distinct bitter taste, but not overpoweringly so. The honey made it the perfect level of sweet. The walnuts added a crunch. Down a different but equally dodgy looking street, I found a falafel bar and enjoyed the best falafels I have ever eaten. Their outside perfectly crunchy, their inside soft and fluffy and heavenly spiced. And the guy gave me a plate of hummus for free! I visited a little bakery and the smell of freshly baked something with cinnamon was so welcoming. I bought a selection of biscuits for my ferry journey, and a slice of pistachio cake. All were delicious, and shockingly cheap.</p>
<img src="/2022/09/10/athens/a2.png" class="" title="Food">

<p>I don’t know why I loved Athens so much. Maybe because I had no expectations and no idea of what it was like. I guess because I’d imagined the ancient stuff to be separate from the city, rather than embedded throughout in a fluid way. As I’m travelling I’m becoming more sure of my gut feelings, and liking Athens is one of those. It’s not very conducive to blog writing though, as it’s hard to verbalise a gut feeling. When I thought about it whilst looking over the whole city from the Pnyx, the image of the heat baking the history into the streets, warming the air from below rather than above, came to mind.</p>

        <p>For the past few months an idea had been forming in my mind. Wild camping is legal in Albania, and I love to camp. I was feeling a bit too comfortable with the whole bus and hostel situation, and wanted a bit more of a challenge. So wouldn’t it be great to buy a tent and do some wild camping on my way through Albania to Greece? I found a rubbish little tent in Montenegro and my idea came to life!</p>
<p>After a night in Berat my plan was to hitchhike with another guy towards the coast and then find somewhere to camp. As I packed up my stuff ready to leave the hostel I struck up conversation with Florence and Tom, a British couple in my room. It turned out that they were driving to the coast and were planning to wild camp in the same location I was aiming for! They invited me to join them and we headed off together. We left the car at the parking spot and walked down the steep path to the beach. The beach was really nice, my first one in Albania! It was small pebbles, with crystal blue water. A tree filled canyon opened up to the beach, with there being some woodlands on the flat before the stones took over. There were a few beach bars on the edge of the trees, and lots of beach loungers and umbrellas out. Not quite the wild, isolated beach we were expecting… Just before it got dark we pitched our tents and cooked up some tuna pasta for dinner. The stars were amazing, and I used my phone’s astrophotography mode for the first time. We went for a drink at the beach bars and discovered a whole campsite in the trees! It was really cool, having a hippie commune vibe to it. </p>
<p>The following day I went for an explore up the canyon, and crossed paths with a Spanish man, Luis, doing the same. We ended up climbing the canyon together, navigating the ropes that were there to help. I only had my birkenstocks so I was glad for his help as he shoved me up the slippier rock faces. A way up we came to a clearing, and Luis asked if I’d like to meditate together. I was a bit taken aback, but in a very embracing mood I agreed. The experience was so balancing and refreshing, if a bit odd. We climbed a bit further before reaching “our end” and then made our way back down - slowly to avoid any injuries. We went our separate ways, thanking each other for the experience we’d just shared. It was a truly wonderful interaction. </p>
<img src="/2022/09/10/camping/a.png" class="" title="Night 1">

<p>By late afternoon we decided it was time to leave the little beach. As we drove I came up with a plan for where I’d spend that evening. Florence and Tom dropped me off in Himare and I went to a hostel where people I’d met previously were staying. I left the majority of my belongings with them, emptying my rucksack to essentials only. The sun was beginning to set at this point so I was in a hurry to get to my sleeping location and get my tent up before it got dark. I had heard about a hidden beach (Filikur beach) round the bay from Himare, only accessible by boat or a risky path with a rope. I thought it sounded like the perfect place to have a proper night of wild camping, ideally having the beach to myself. Because people had warned me that the path down was a bit hairy, when I took a wrong turn and the path became loose rocks down the cliff face I didn’t question it too much. I had to take my bag off to slide down. I would lower my bag down a little and then slide myself down after it. This worked well at first, until the drop was a bit too big and my bag slid then started to tumble and roll down the cliff, picking up speed. Without panicking I slid down quickly after it, knowing I needed to catch up to it. This worked out fine, but left me covered in dirt and with pretty cut up legs and a cut up bum, oops! At this point I saw a man coming up from the beach, and shouted to him if this was the best way down. He exclaimed that I was not on the path! I laughed and asked for his help to rejoin the path. The guy seemed a bit freaked out. The rest of the way down was easy in comparison, it was very steep and bare rock, but the rope meant you could abseil down safely. There was one last couple left on the beach. I found a slightly less pebbley spot to set up my tent (I hadn’t bothered to buy a sleeping mat…). As I did so a boat arrived to pick up the last couple, and they waved me off energetically. I waved back, imagining their view of me - a little girl becoming a dot on the beach, setting up her tent. Their excitement added to my own. Once I’d finished setting up I stripped down naked and swam, washing off all of the dirt from sliding down the cliff and letting the salt help my cuts. I’d already laid out my plethora of food available for dinner - I hadn’t had time to get anything substantial to eat so it was crackers with peanut butter and marmite, a peach and some remaining oat biscuits. I ate sat naked in the entrance to my tent. I felt like I was the only person in the world. I watched the last light go. As it got dark I retreated inside the tent. I watched the lightning on the horizon anxiously, and listened to the thunder with bated breath. Hoping it wouldn’t rain on me tonight, as there was no way my tent was waterproof. The less fun side was the reality of having to sleep alone on a beach… I psyched myself out, with every rock falling from the cliff being someone coming to break into my tent. The ground was extremely uncomfortable, with the jumper under my shoulder blades and a pair of shorts under my hips doing little to soften it. It was clammy and hot, with the layers of salt and sweat on my skin being as uncomfortable as the ground. Weird sand hopper insects had snuck into my tent and would randomly land on me, with one jumping up my nostril at one point. Unsurprisingly, this was not the recipe for a good night’s sleep and I slept poorly. But this lifted the entire experience, making it more real, more memorable and honestly better. At 7am I got up. I sat and took in my view. It really was amazing. In my bikini I ate my banana, feeling like a true beach urchin and loving it. I had one last homemade oat biscuit leftover from the batch I made before leaving Kotor. I nibbled at it, my lips brushing my finger tips occasionally and getting a taste of salt from them. Once I’d swam, and with the first people arriving to the beach, I felt much safer and was able to sleep for a few more hours. In the early afternoon I packed up my tent and climbed back up the cliff, using the rope and following the path this time. I hadn’t showered in a few days; my hair was crunchy with salt; my skin was sticky; I hadn’t had a proper meal in days; my whole body ached from sleeping on the stones and I couldn’t lift my arms above shoulder height; and I was covered in cuts. I was truly elated. It had been amazing. I bought a cold sprite from the shop and had a long shower at the hostel.</p>
<img src="/2022/09/10/camping/b.png" class="" title="Night 2">

<p>I left my tent behind as I left Albania. It had served me well, even just for two nights. I am so happy I made my camping dream happen.</p>

        <p>I visited Albania three times in total: once with Rosaline where we spent a few days in Shkoder and Tirana; once to do the Valbone - Theth hike; and then two weeks travelling around the South. If I were to have written this post after my first visit, my review of Albania would have been lukewarm. We had an enjoyable time in Shkoder, playing cards in a bird watching hide looking over the lake. But beyond that, it wasn’t the most pleasant experience. I was eaten alive by insects by the lake. Our visit to Lumi i Shales (a beautiful river area) was fun but it was so strange with lots of weird restaurants and there was a lot of litter, and the organisation of the buses was carnage. I convinced myself we were being trafficked whilst on the bus from Shkoder to Tirana. The museums in Tirana were abysmal, featuring English translations so poor that Rosaline and I would finish reading them and give each other a look that said “do have any understanding of what that said?” (I’ve included my favourite one below). We were met with bad, almost rude, service at every restaurant. The taxi drivers at the bus station were aggressive. Tirana itself gave me the most bad vibes of any city I’ve visited. The angry red and black flag of Albania hung from flag poles every 10 metres down the main street in a war-like fashion. The buildings were ugly. The only saving grace was the walking tour we did, which was one of my favourite ones so far. I had no idea about Albanian history and it’s now the one I’m most interested in, especially their communist period. My reading list is filled with Albanian history books! My favourite titbits are the fact that Albania fell out with both the Soviet Union and China for them not being “communist enough”, and the crazy ponzi schemes that occurred after communism fell in the 1990s. My second visit to Albania was amazing, and is covered in the post about the Valbone - Theth hike. But this was because of the hike, and not really because of Albania in a more full sense. Now my third visit, that was quite a different story.</p>
<img src="/2022/09/10/albania/1.png" class="" title="First visit to Albania">

<p>I visited the medieval towns of Berat and Gjirokaster. Berat was fine, nothing much to see. Gjirokaster was wonderful. The castle and the old houses were brilliantly done, with plentiful information boards in good English and even an included tour at the house. There was a festival taking place at the castle in the evenings, with live music. I’ve been lucky enough to see quite a lot of live music over my trip, but the band on the first night was the best so far. Who knew Albanian indie rock would be so good! One evening a group of us walked over to Ali Pasha’s bridge and we witnessed a very rural sight. We came round the corner and suddenly we had a view of the valley and the impressive, old, stone bridge branching across it. We made our way down to the bridge, walking across carefully and sitting on the other side. We chatted and just observed the surroundings. Slowly, we saw the farmers bringing in their animals from the hillside. First was a solitary donkey. Then some sheep on the opposite side of the valley. And finally, from the hill behind us, a herd of goats! We watched as they crossed the bridge. It was really beautiful.</p>
<img src="/2022/09/10/albania/3.png" class="" title="Berat and Gjirokaster">

<p>Over the past few months I’d been banking lots of reviews about places along the Albanian coast, and subconsciously forming an opinion of which sounded best. This resulted in me only visiting Himare, and skipping the more famous towns of Sarande and Ksamil. Himare was so peaceful and I really loved it. Mainly because of the hostel. It was my favourite hostel so far (Sun Bakers if anyone is wanting to go!). I can’t explain why I loved it so much, I just did. I gave me such feelings of warmth and comfort, a real home away from home. Maybe because I was with people I’d spent the last week with - friends I’d originally made in Kotor or met in previous places in Albania. Maybe because I allowed myself to properly relax here. Maybe because the french toast at breakfast was so good. The only activity I did was hire kayaks with a few others. We were aiming for a little beach around the headland but found a small cove on the way and spent a few hours here. Our very own private beach. Complete with a cave and high rocks perfect for climbing.</p>
<img src="/2022/09/10/albania/2.png" class="" title="The coast">

<p>Albania and I have been on a journey. At the moment I’m still not sure of my opinion. But I definitely look upon it fondly, and I find myself talking about my time there a lot so it definitely made an impression. It’s not my favourite country - still Slovenia - but it is a country that takes up a lot of space in my head. Its history is insane. Its current state remains pretty insane, as I learnt from my discussion with an Albanian girl on the bus, including her own mafia ties… Its mountains are beautiful, but the mountain towns are strange. The coast is beautiful in places, but tacky and ugly in others. It is very very cheap. My time there was fun and odd. I don’t think I’d go back. Not because I don’t recommend it, but because I don’t want to tarnish the experience I had there. I think it will change a lot in the coming years, with tourism increasing, and I’d like to remember it as the strange, wacky county I experienced.</p>

        <p>I have a very short travelling bucket list, and one item on that list is to volunteer at a hostel. Ever since I stayed in a hostel alone for the first time in Mexico and realised it was a thing it’s been something that I’ve wanted to do. I also really wanted to spend a few weeks in one place, and properly get to know it. August seemed like the perfect time to do this, everywhere was getting a lot busier which isn’t my favourite thing, and hostels were booking up in advance which messes with my one or two days ahead style of planning. I’d had a busy first 3 months so 4 weeks of staying still and having a routine was very appealing. I originally looked at Albania and found a few opportunities on workaway. My criteria was:</p>
<ul>
<li>A town with something going on. Nice cafes to write in, nice restaurants to try out, museums to visit.</li>
<li>Somewhere very close to swim each day.</li>
<li>Can get to other places from it by bus, to explore more of the area.</li>
<li>Hiking in the area.</li>
<li>Good hostel vibe, social etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of the places in Albania had all of these, so I was struggling to decide which to go for. In my indecision I arrived in Kotor for the first time. Here I found a place that had everything I was looking for, so I asked about volunteering in August and that was that. </p>

<p>Kotor is such an interesting place. It’s located on the inner most point of a strange double bay. It has a beautiful old town which is filled with cats and kittens, with legend being that the felines protect the town. Kotor has two museums: a cat museum and a maritime museum. I visited and would recommend both. It has a fruit and veg market every morning by the wall of the old town. Their figs were especially good. It is surrounded my steep black mountains. The sun sets down into the bay, and it makes the mountains look almost purple and as if they’re a green screen. They rise so suddenly from the water, they don’t look real. Up above the old town, around half way up the mountain, is an old fort with old walls going up to it on either side. These were illuminated at night by soft golden lights. If you swam at night you could float on you back and look up at the cliffs and gaze at the illuminated arc of the old walls. All reflected in the black water around you. It was always a wonderful way to end the day. Kotor was lovely and quiet in June when I first visited, but it was much busier in August. The beach would be empty first thing in the morning, but after that it became horribly busy. The water became less clear too. A weird thing about Kotor is the ever present cruise ships that silently arrive and leave in the night. These huge boats look so out of place, but they soon become part of the landscape. I still can’t figure out why Kotor is a stop for them, especially as it must be a pain to get to from the open sea.</p>
<p>I was there for two carnivals - one on land and one in the sea, with the floats being on little boats. They both ended in fireworks, and I do love fireworks.</p>

<h3 id="Montenegro-Hostel-4-U"><a href="#Montenegro-Hostel-4-U" class="headerlink" title="Montenegro Hostel 4 U"></a>Montenegro Hostel 4 U</h3><p>The hostel was a party hostel, but I stuck by my intention for the month of relaxing and getting into a healthy routine. I woke up early each morning and did some exercise. I ran my first ever 5km! I’d do some yoga and then swim in the sea. I’d join Isabel, another volunteer, for breakfast and we’d make delicious porridge. Isabel and I alternated between the morning shift, changing the beds, and the evening shift, doing the ironing and odd jobs. When I wasn’t working I’d mostly relax at the beach, explore the old town, take out a paddle board or chill at the hostel. I did one big hike, and then never found the time to do anymore. I found that I really enjoyed helping out the guests with travel questions - giving them tips on what to do in Kotor, on where the best bakery was and the best places in Montenegro to visit. I met so many lovely travellers, and a few less lovely ones. But as I’ve been back on the road travelling south I only seem to have bumped into the lovely ones. I wonder how far I’ll need to go before I stop bumping into people that visited Kotor whilst I was working. The other volunteers were also, mostly, lovely. For the majority of my time working there were four of us, all girls. We went out for a couple of nice dinners together, and spent time working and chatting in cafes. I really did fall into a sleepy routine and the days passed quickly. I think I would’ve started to get bored if Tarsha and Alex hadn’t come and visit, but after they left I had less than a week remaining and it suddenly seemed like I had a lot to squeeze in! I didn’t do nearly as much as I thought I would, in terms of hiking, writing, planning, or online courses. But I got all the rest I needed, and I felt properly at home in Kotor. And those were my only real aims for the month.</p>
<img src="/2022/08/31/hostel-work/porridge.png" class="" title="Home cooked food">

<p>The hostel wasn’t perfect of course, it was quite disorganised which made me feel bad for the guests at times. I felt that it charged too much money for the activities we put on, but the activities were fun - a family BBQ and a sunset kayaking tour. The staff room where we slept was always so messy and dirty, especially the bathroom. It was the type of dirtiness that meant even after showering you didn’t feel clean. The few nights I spent in Alex and Tarsha’s airbnb were a wonderful break from this! We had one volunteer who left but then returned who was a bit of headache. So whilst I was sad to say goodbye to Kotor I was definitely ready to be back on the road!</p>
<img src="/2022/08/31/hostel-work/people.png" class="" title="Friends from Kotor">

<p>Being still gave me time to reflect on my future travels. I’m feeling really content and chilled out about it all. And excited of course. When I started my energy was so high, and I was so happy all of the time. I knew then that it was unsustainable, and I was nervous for a big crash. But instead it’s just settled down. This current level of contentedness is sustainable, so I’m no longer worried about it running out.</p>

        <p><em>With Alex and Tarsha</em></p>
<p>How do you know you have wonderful friends? They’ll fly out to Montenegro to meet you and go along with hiring a car from a Serbian guy to have a road trip. Alex joined me on the 18th August, with Tarsha joining a few days later. I sorted the hire car through the hostel I’m working at, with a guy bringing it to the hostel, showing me (without speaking English) how to operate it, signing a single sheet of paper and paying in cash the 90EUR for the 3 days. Insurance? No idea. Luckily we didn’t need to find out, although we had a close call at one point with Alex smashing the wing mirror… Our noble steed was a 2006 Fiat Panda (please see below), which, surprisingly, drove wonderfully. Our route is shown below, with red being us driving and orange an additional trip.</p>
<img src="/2022/08/24/roadtrip/1.png" class="" title="Roadtrip route">

<p>After collecting Alex from the airport we made our way to Kolasin. The first part of the drive was pretty stressful, with the road being a single track winding up the mountain and the other road users being locals zooming down taking up the whole road. But after that the drive was honestly wonderful. Despite the RAC’s warning of poor road conditions in Montenegro (thanks for the research Al) the rolling tarmac ascending and descending through the mountains was very enjoyable to drive on. The final part of the drive was through a canyon and wow it was impressive. The sun was setting so the colours were lovely, and the scenery even more dramatic. We passed through a huge number of tunnels, many hand cut into the rock. We stopped at a monastery which had a well kept garden. Darkness had just about descended when we made it to Kolasin and we found a cosy looking restaurant to eat, and to give Alex his first taste of Balkan food. I drove the short distance remaining to the airbnb and we saw our accommodation for the next two nights. Thank god we’re good friends and Alex hadn’t had the lamb shank at dinner! The “tiny cabin on wheels” was a perfectly apt name. Alex slept badly, and therefore so did I.</p>
<img src="/2022/08/24/roadtrip/2.png" class="" title="Tiny cabin">

<p>After being told breakfast had stopped being served at the campsite we enjoyed a Balkan breakfast en route to Biogradska Gora, our first national park! Montenegro has five national parks, with Biogradska Gora being the smallest but apparently the prettiest. Leaving our car at Biogradska lake we hiked up Bendovac mountain. The walk reminded me of England, zigzagging up through forest. Once at the top however the scenery was much more unique. The mountain valley was open and green, with blueberry bushes dotted around. There were two farm houses with little huts surrounding them, traditionally used by shepherds but now open to hikers. It was gorgeous. The view and the atmosphere of the little farms made it my favourite national park that we visited. Back down at the lake I was less impressed, with the lake being a bit murky and muddy. We hurried back to the tiny hut to use the hot tub as it was closed the previous night, only to be told it was still shut for cleaning. Disappointed, we played cards as it got dark.</p>
<img src="/2022/08/24/roadtrip/3.png" class="" title="Biogradska Gora">

<p>Waking early the next morning we headed west across Montenegro to our second national park, Durmitor. This is the most famous one and is home to the tallest peak in the country, Bobotuv Kuk. On our drive over we stopped to take a closer took at the Tara river, stumbling across a traditional wooden raft we were able to clamber on. We enjoyed breakfast in the ski town of Zabljak before visiting Crno Jezero (the Black Lake). This was Alex’s favourite spot, and I appreciated it too. The lake was very blue, with mountains rising up on one side. The edge was lined with trees, and the water level had receded so the vibrant green reeds were exposed in places. The water was the perfect temperature, and we enjoyed a swim. We could’ve spent all day there, and it would’ve been a great place to swim after hiking Bobotuv Kuk. Alas, Tarsha had now landed in Kotor and so we began the drive back to meet her, making a brief detour to get a better look at the mountains. I wish I had had more time to spend in Durmitor, especially to hike the mountain. We decided to spend time in Biogradska Gora and I’m very glad we did, with the hike there being different to the ones I’d done previously in Slovenia and Albania, whereas Bobotuv Kuk would’ve been very similar. Even with a month in Montenegro there’s still so much more I’d like to do!</p>
<img src="/2022/08/24/roadtrip/4.png" class="" title="Durmitor">

<p>Tarsha and Isabel (another volunteer at the hostel) had been busy in our absence buying supplies for a sunset picnic. We drove up to a fortress way above the Kotor bay. Someone had just finished painting faces all over one of the interior walls so we explored the labyrinth of rooms under the smell of varnish. We chose our location on top of one of the turrets for our picnic. The sunset was beautiful, even if the sun did disappear behind a cloud before it hit the sea.</p>
<img src="/2022/08/24/roadtrip/5.png" class="" title="Sunset at the fortress">

<p>To fit in one last national park before the hire car was collected, we left at 6am for Lovcen national park. This is the closest one to Kotor. Tarsha drove us up the dreaded Kotor Serpentine and we admired the rocky yet green landscape of Lovcen. It was so different to both Durmitor and Biogradska Gora. We reached the Mausoleum which is on the second highest peak in the park, only to be told it didn’t open until 9am and we weren’t allowed to go up to the top. Undeterred we headed to the highest peak instead. This is where the Fiat Panda really impressed, as did Tarsha’s driving. The track up was more rock than road, and it was very slow going with us all anxiously listening to the twangs of rocks hitting the metal underside. After 20 or so minutes we found somewhere to park up that was wide enough for us to turn around, and we walked the final bit to the top. The views were outstanding. </p>
<img src="/2022/08/24/roadtrip/6.png" class="" title="Lovcen">

<p>I handed the keys back to the same Serbian man that dropped it off, nervous for him to find some issue with it. Needlessly so, he didn’t even look at the car before driving off.</p>
<p>And so ended our few days driving around Montenegro. It was my first time properly driving abroad, and a left hand drive car. It was a great experience and the freedom it gives over public transport is insane. In countries where it’s affordable I’d absolutely recommend hiring a car for a few days!</p>
<p>The rest of Alex and Tarsha’s visit was more relaxed, with beach days, ambles around Old Town, copious amounts of Monopoly deal and eating good food. I convinced them to do one last adventurous thing with me, which was a rafting trip. This took us all the way back up past Durmitor to the stretch of the Tara canyon on the Bosnia and Hercegovina border. The Tara canyon is the second largest canyon in the world, behind the Grand Canyon. It was great to see more of Montenegro on the drive up. The rafting itself was hilarious, with my face hurting from laughing by the end. The atmosphere was insane, mostly caused by the strange weather, and of course the scenery. The canyon was beautiful, very green and the water was crystal clear. We drank straight from the river. The weather began dry, but with crazy clouds falling low in the canyon, cutting the mountain view into fragments. At times it would pour with rain. At one point it hailed aggressively. We were soaking wet from both the spray of the white water and the rain. It was wonderful. We swam and cliff jumped at one point, and found the water to be absolutely freezing. After the swim the cold set in and we paddled more aggressively to keep warm. We stopped at a waterfall and a weird bar set up on the canyon side, at this point we were in Bosnia. It wasn’t much further until we reached our finishing point. There had been some tears (from a Welsh lady in the boat as she shouted at the other boat to stop splashing, which was very funny), but we’d all survived! We got dry and changed into our warm clothes and I had the exact feeling of finishing a few hours body boarding and swimming in the sea in the rain in Woolacombe, and getting changed in the cold to finally be all cosy in a hoody and comfy trousers. It was wonderful. I’ve found it so interesting how having experiences and feelings that remind me of home stops me feeling homesick. The things I miss about home can be recreated and that does the job perfectly! We had a wonderful lunch - delicious soup followed by fish and beef with potatoes (again, reminding me of home strangely) with salad and bread. </p>
<img src="/2022/08/24/roadtrip/7.png" class="" title="Tara canyon rafting">

<p>Then the 22nd rolled around and it was time for Tarsha and Alex to leave. I waved them off in the taxi and then bought a huge punnet of fresh figs to cheer myself up. I’m so lucky to have friends who have come out to visit, and I appreciate it so much. And not just because they bring me out Marmite, Cadbury’s chocolate and skincare products… So thank you very much to Tarsha (and Alex, but he repeatedly told me he doesn’t read the blog so this is a pointless addition) for flying out and for your wonderful company!</p>
